# FourConnect

## Description
FourConnect is a meticulously crafted implementation of the classic Connect Four game, developed as part of a college project. Written in C, this project offers an engaging and strategic gaming experience.

## Features
- Classic Connect Four gameplay.
- Implemented in C for educational purposes.
- User-friendly interface and intuitive gameplay mechanics.
- Suitable for players of all skill levels.
- Encourages collaboration and critical thinking skills.
- Open-source project, welcoming contributions from developers.

## How it Works
- The game is implemented using a grid-based data structure to represent the game board.
- Players take turns placing colored discs on the grid.
- The program checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has connected four discs in a row.
- It employs various algorithms to efficiently check for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections.
- The game ends when a player successfully connects four discs or when the game board is full (resulting in a tie).
- The user interface includes prompts for player input and displays the current state of the game board.
